# Operating Systems Processes
Process creation and communication in Unix using fork, wait, pipe, kill, signal.

Files are used to pass information from child processes to parent process. Program is executed as *part1 n* to use the first *n* input files in the file order, each named as input[i].txt. Parent process creates *n* children processes. 

## Child Processes
Each child process sorts the numbers in the input file and writes the intermediate output file. 
  
### Input File Format:
[m]   //number of numbers <br />
number_1 number_2 number_3 ... number_m   //unsorted numbers
  
### Output File Format:
[m]   //number of numbers <br />
sortednumber_1sortednumber_2 sortednumber_3 ... sortednumber_m    //sorted numbers <br />
[execution time in seconds]   //execution time of the process <br />
[name of the signal received, e.g., SIGUSR2, and receive time, e.g., 11:37:44]  //signal received information

## Parent Process
Parent reads the intermediate files when all children processes finish. It also sends a signal to each active child. Send SIGUSR1 if child id odd, SIGUSR2 if itâ€™s even. Once all intermediate files are read, parent process creates a single output file called parentOutput.txt which consists of each output files' information.

### Parent Output File Format:
output[i].txt   //output file name <br />
[m]   //number of numbers <br />
sortednumber_1sortednumber_2 sortednumber_3 ... sortednumber_m    //sorted numbers <br />
[execution time in seconds]   //execution time of the process <br />
[name of the signal received, e.g., SIGUSR2, and receive time, e.g., 11:37:44]    //signal received information

output[i+1].txt   <br />
[m]   <br />

[execution time in seconds]   <br />
[name of the signal received and receive time]
